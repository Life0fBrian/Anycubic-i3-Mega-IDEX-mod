# Anycubic-i3-Mega-IDEX-mod
This mod converts the Anycubic i3 Mega into an IDEX 3D printer.

The project is currently still in its design phase and has not been brought to life yet.
It uses a 1515 aluminum extrusion and MGN12 linear rail for the X gantry.
(The printer itself will get a linear rail mod for the bed as well and upgrades to 24V.)

The two independent print heads are driven by 1.8Â° Nema17 pancake stepper motors to save weight.
It uses E3D compatible V6 hotends with M12 threaded heatsinks and ceramic heating cores to get a small size:

The coldend will be cooled by a 30 mm axial fan and the printed model is being cooled by a powerful GDSTIME 4010 radial fan with 12k RPM.

Intention is to print the parts with ASA-CF for more rigidity. But ABS or ASA should be fine as well.

## Features:
- slim print heads
- MGN12 linear rails with MGN12C blocks
- V6 hotends with CHC blocks and threaded heatsinks
- 30 mm coldend fan
- 4010 mm radial fan for part cooling
- endstops on both ends of the X rail and on right print head to have multiple homing options
- bowden setups for light weight print heads

## Electronics:
- You will need a board with at least 7 driver sockets.
- Upgrade to 24 V PSU and board and all fans (mind the heating bed as well!).
