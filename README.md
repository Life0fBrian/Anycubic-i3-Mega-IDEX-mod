This project is currently still in its design phase and has not been brought to life yet.
It uses a 1515 aluminum extrusion and MGN12 linear rail for the X gantry.
(The printer itself will get a linear rail mod for the bed as well.)

The two independent print heads are driven by 1.8Â° Nema17 pancake stepper motors to save weight.
It uses E3D compatible V6 hotends with M12 threaded heatsinks and ceramic heating cores to get a small size:

The coldend will be cooled by a 30 mm axial fan and the printed model is being cooled by a powerful GDSTIME 4010 radial fan with 12k RPM.
